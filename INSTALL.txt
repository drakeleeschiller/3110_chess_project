In the terminal, navigate to the directory in which you saved the 
3110_chess_project folder, and then go into the 3110_chess_project.

Once in the folder, run 'make clean', 'make build' to create all the build 
files necessary to play the game. 

Afterwards, run 'make play' to load the game, and type start to play the game. 
Instructions on how to start, quit, and see the rules will also be shown
immediately after running 'make play', but will be described below regardless.

Available commands after running 'make play':
1. 'start': loads the game
2. 'quit': quits the program (without ever loading the game)
3. 'rules': gives you the rules on how to play chess on our program 
(Note: 'rules' does not give you the rules for chess. We assume the user
already knows standard chess rules)

Available commands after loading the game (i.e. inputting 'start'):
1. 'go [pos1] [pos2]': moves the piece in [pos1] to [pos2] if valid. 
    Example:
        If the first command after loading is 'go a2 a4', the pawn on a2 moves 
        to the square a4. 
2. 'castle [direction]' castles in the given direction (left or right)
2. 'quit': lets you quit the program
3. 'rules': shows you the rules to on how play chess on our program
